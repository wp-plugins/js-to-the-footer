== Description ==
This plugin moves all of your JS and Scripts to the footer and loads your CSS and images first, your website speeds up and you avoid a flickr of un-styled content. 

If a website is loaded in a browser using HTTP, scripts donâ€™t allow parallel downloads, this way a JavaScript file may take 4-5 seconds to load, blocking your CSS files.

IMPORTANT: Some plugins may conflict with this or not load correctly! This is due to the plugins specified script load order, and not JS to the Foot's fault. Please report any findings to the plugin support page!
